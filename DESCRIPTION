Description: Counts occurrences of motifs in bipartite networks, as well as the number of
    times each node appears in each unique position within motifs. Intended for
    use in ecology, but its methods are general and can be applied to any
    bipartite network. Uses operations directly on the incidence matrix so that
    analyses are fast, even for large matrices.
